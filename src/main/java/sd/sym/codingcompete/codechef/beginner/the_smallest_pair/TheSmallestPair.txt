You are given a sequence a1, a2, ..., aN. Find the smallest possible value of ai + aj, where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N.
Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. 

The first line of each description consists of a single integer N.

The second line of each description contains N space separated integers - a1, a2, ..., aN respectively.
Output

For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer - the smallest possible sum for the corresponding test case.
Constraints

    T = 105, N = 2 : 13 points.
    T = 105, 2 ≤ N ≤ 10 : 16 points.
    T = 1000, 2 ≤ N ≤ 100 : 31 points.
    T = 10, 2 ≤ N ≤ 105 : 40 points.
    1 ≤ ai ≤ 106
